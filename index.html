        <h2>What Information Technology Entails</h2>
        <p>
          Information Technology (IT) is a business sector that deals with
          computing, including hardware, software, telecommunications and
          generally anything involved in the transmittal of information or the
          systems that faciliate communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information technology is building communications networks for a
          company, safeguarding data and information, creating and administering
          databases, helping employees troubleshoot problems with their
          computers or mobile devices, or doing a range of other work to ensure
          the efficiency and security of business information systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most basic information technology definition is that it's the
          application of technology to solve business or organizational problems
          on a broad scale. No matter the role, a member of an IT department
          works with others to solve technology problems, both big and small.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the Information Technology Industry About?</h3>
        <p>
          Commercial and employment perspective. Companies in the information
          technology field are often discussed as a group as the "tech sector"
          or the "tech industry". Many companies now have IT departments for
          managing the computers, networks, and other technical areas of their
          businesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>You don't necessarily need a college degree to work in IT. Some technicians may come with college coursework, education, training or certifications while other some employers will require at least a bachelor's degree. Depending on your role in IT, you could even be expected to come with a master's degree in computer science, information science or technology.
            Another consideration that varies from employer to employer is how much, if any, work experience is expected. </p>
            <p>Entry-level IT jobs might consider candidates with less than one year of experience in the workplace or previous experience as an intern. Midlevel IT jobs typically require at least three years on the job, while senior-level jobs can require nine or more years of work experience. Another consideration is that lacking education can be spoken for with more experience or vice versa.
            Regardless of the precise position, It is useful for most IT specialists to have exceptional analytical, organizational, decision-making, leadership and communication skills.</p>
            <p> It will also prove useful to be familiar with project management and customer management software, server operating systems, web platform development software and various computer equipment to boost your desirability to employers.</p>
            <h3 id="title">IT Job Titles</h3>
            <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
            <p>Software engineers create software using skills in mathematical analysis, 
                computer science and engineering principles and knowledge of programming or coding languages and algorithms. 
                They might develop software for operating systems, computer games, middleware (i.e., software that provides services to software applications), business
                 applications or network control systems. A software engineer stays informed on rapidly changing technologies associated with the profession and designs,
                  tests and develops software to meet the needs of their clients.</p>
            <h4>Network Administrator</h4>
            <p>Network administrators manage the daily operations of computer networks. They recommend upgrades as technology changes to keep the company's network up-to-date and running safely and efficiently. They also install all network hardware and software, train team members on how to use it, provide technical oversight and maintenance and troubleshoot for any problems.</p>
            <h4>Web Developer</h4>
            <p>Web developers build, create, maintain and modify websites. The design is dependent on the clients' needs and how they plan to reach their consumers or provide them with access to their products or services. There are different types of web developers, including those that work on the back end of a site and those that work on the front end. Front-end developers add user-friendly layouts, style and functionality to the website while back-end developers create code to help users indirectly access applications on the server-side.</p>
            <h4>Computer Programer</h4>
            <p>Computer programmers create code, or instructions that a computer follows when users access various features, for software applications and operating systems. Once developed, they test the program to ensure the proper functioning and rewrite it as needed. They review programs regularly or as problems arise to evaluate and correct any disruptions or errors to the code.</p>
            <h4>Information Security Analyst</h4>
            <p>Information security analysts protect computer networks and systems from security breaches. Their aim is to keep attackers known as hackers out of a company's or organization's system in order to secure sensitive information. They monitor the networks, install firewalls and other data protection software and simulate cyber-attacks to find potential problems. Analysts identify issues and make recommendations for changes.</p>
            <h4>Data Architect</h4>
            <p>Data architects build and integrate data systems and their varied components. In workplaces using multiple data sources on different systems, a data architect ensures that the computer system for the company or organization can handle the various streams effectively and with minimal to no errors. When complications do arise, they troubleshoot the problems and eradicate them to continue the business's use of uninterrupted information streams. They might need to build structures to allow new data sources to allow for growth and change. Security, the integrity of the system, upkeep and clear standards for managing results are also integral to this role.</p>

It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of sophisticated hackers.”

            IT security specialists work hard to prevent large breaches that can jeopardize the health of any size business. When a breach event occurs, technicians work in teams to follow an incident response plan. This effort acts as a risk management tool to gain control of the situation.</p>

        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>We all depend on the software and those that develop it for business and personal use. IT specialists design and build applications, programming, and system software. They do this work by coding the instructions that tell computers what to do and allow users to carry out tasks.

            Programming languages are used to provide the functionality to address specific business or personal needs. IT technicians learn the most popular languages in their college training and professional development courses.
            Laptop computers are popular for developing software. They should be high-spec laptops that are portable with high-speed processors that contain multiple cores, thread count, and solid-state disks. Developers then have the speed necessary to perform their work without frustration.</p>
      <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
      <p>Another viable career path for IT pros is working with quality assurance. They test and troubleshoot software before it is released to the public to make sure it works correctly. This job consists of organizing and implementing three steps that include:
<ul>
       <li> Gathering Requirements – Here the employee defines what should be in the descriptions and acceptance criteria.</li>
       <li> Implementing the Requirements – This is the stage where software quality is improved with the right software development practices.</li>
       <li> Testing Stage – In this stage, the activities in the software are verified and validated for proper functioning.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
